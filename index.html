        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I’m Daniel Luis. I live in Corrente Piauí. A town located in the Northeast of Brazil, where I made
            good friends
            and really feel at home. I like living here where I'm close to my family. What motivated me to learn
            programming was to
            be able to dream of better working conditions and income. Thus, in this journey I have discovered many
            things, the art
            of learning along life, since education can transform people and people transform the world.
        </p>
        <h2>Study</h2>
        <p>
            On the way to improve myself professionally, I started my studies in IT in 2010. Then I did the Full
            Licentiate Degree
            in Pedagogy at the State University (UESPI). For the past two I have the opportunity to be studying
            Technology in
            Analysis and Development.
        </p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
            Moving on, I’m going to talk a bit about myself. I’ve been looking for opportunities as a web developer
            remotely. I have
            become entangled in courses and looking for certificates and stamps. I take a Higher Course in Technology
            and Analysis
            and Systems Development at IFPI. I know that the path is long and that it takes dedication and that a higher
            education
            or certification is not always enough. For this reason, I dedicate myself, doing projects and deepening
            myself in
            technologies. As an example, in the last of my projects I did a django site for ecommerce. It was wonderful,
            I learned a
            lot, and I keep improving the site . I've also done projects in JS, HTML and pure CSS. And I have worked
            with
            technologies like React and ReactNative too. All these projects have covered the concepts like Programming
            Logic, OOP,
            Database, Software Engineering, Data Structure, Network Studies and Computer Architecture, which are just
            some of the
            subjects of continuous learning.
